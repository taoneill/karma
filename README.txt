Karma is a custom Bukkit plugin for my Minecraft server: the Warhub.

It was put together quickly to automatically handling ranking and groups.

Players get a start amount of karma points (according to their existing rank) and all further promotions and demotions are determined by karma.

Karma points are distributed during play, can be gifted and are removed if you spend more than a day offline.

Karma is basically a server economy that determines ranks, but under another non-monetary name.
